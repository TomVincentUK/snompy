pysnom
======

A Python package for modelling scanning near-field optical microscopy measurements.

Overview
--------
The main purpose of ``pysnom`` is to provide functions to calculate the effective polarizability, of a SNOM tip and a sample, which can be used to predict contrast in SNOM measurements.
It also contains other useful features for SNOM modelling, such as an implementation of the transfer matrix method for calculating far-field reflection coefficients of multilayer samples, and code for simulating lock-in amplifier demodulation of arbitrary functions.

-------
When we release this package, we'll accompany it with a paper showcasing its use.
I'll add a reference to that paper here and ask people to cite it if they use the code.
