User guide
==========

This is the user guide for the Python package ``finite-dipole``, which is
an implementation of the finite dipole model (FDM) for predicting contrasts
in scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM)
measurements.

Here we provide examples of how to use this package, along with an
explanation of how the FDM is implemented.
You won't need a detailed understanding of the FDM to understand this
guide, but it'll be helpfull to know the basics of SNOM and atomic force
microscopy (AFM).
For more detailed documentation of the functions provided by this package,
see :doc:`../API/API_index`.
