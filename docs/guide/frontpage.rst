User guide
==========

This is the user guide for the Python package ``pysnom``, which is
an implementation of the finite dipole model (FDM) and the point dipole
model (PDM) for predicting contrasts in scattering-type scanning near-field
optical microscopy (SNOM) measurements.

Here we provide examples of how to use this package, along with an
explanation of how the models are implemented.
You won't need a detailed understanding of the FDM or PDM to understand
this guide, but it'll be helpful to know the basics of SNOM and atomic
force microscopy (AFM).
For more detailed documentation of the functions provided by this package,
see :ref:`API`.
