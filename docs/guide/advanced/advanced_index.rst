Advanced topics
===============

This section should feature some advanced topics such as:

* Fitting to the finite-dipole model
    * Single harmonic fits for dielectric function and thickness
    * Global fits
* Eliminating residual contributions from far-field and static E-fields
    * Taking ratios and why to do it
    * Global fits with the results?
