.. _demodulation:

Demodulation
============

This page should describe how demodulation is implemented in ``pysnom``, with an example of how to use it to demodulate an arbitrary function.
It should also demonstrate that AFM tapping needs to be offset by the amplitude for :math:`z_{tip} = 0` to avoid intersecting with the sample.
