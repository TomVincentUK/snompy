    Please do!
    This package is open source and free to use.
    We only ask that you cite our original paper, to acknowledge the time and effort that went into developing ``pysnom``.
    See the section :ref:`cite` to find out how.

.. admonition:: How can I cite ``pysnom``?
    :class:  dropdown admonition-faq

    See the section :ref:`cite` for details.

.. admonition:: I'm not sure how to use ``pysnom`` for my research. Can you do it for me?
    :class:  dropdown admonition-faq

    Perhaps, if your project is interesting and aligns with our research then we're open to new opportunities for collaboration.
    Feel free to contact the authors privately if you're interested in working with us on modelling SNOM experiments.

.. admonition:: I'd like to see a certain feature. Can you add it?
    :class:  dropdown admonition-faq

    Possibly.
    We're always happy to discuss ways to improve this code.
    The section :doc:`development` gives details of how to raise feature requests.

.. admonition:: Which FDM implementation should I use?
    :class:  dropdown admonition-faq

    The authors of ``pysnom`` don't advocate for any particular implementation over another.
    We stress that, despite their differences, all the FDM implementations included in ``pysnom`` have shown good agreement with experimental results in literature.
    However we agree that more work can be done to determine which models are most applicable for different sample types and geometries.
    If you're interested in using ``pysnom`` to help with that work, then please let us know!
    We'll be very happy to help.
