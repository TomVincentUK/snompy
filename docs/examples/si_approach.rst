Approach curve on silicon
=========================

This example uses both the FDM and PDM  to calculate the decay of the SNOM amplitude, :math:`s_n \propto \alpha_{eff, n}`, for different demodulation harmonics, :math:`n` as the SNOM tip is moved in the :math:`z` direction, away from a sample of bulk silicon.
